How to compile styles for ckanext-tour?

I didn't have much time to setup scripts, so just used `sass`

https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass

Usage:

1. Install with `npm install -g npx sass`
2. Run from this folder like that `npx sass --watch styles.scss:./../assets/css/style.css`
3. Remove `--watch` if you just need to build styles once.
